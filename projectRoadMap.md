# Project Overview
- As this is a writing heavy adventure game that plans to cover more in depth topics than traditional games, the first week has been mostly spent with me just writing down ideas and philosophy in a secondary article. I'm taking inspirations from 17776 for this project and its ideas (Really great story, go look it up, its mind-bending!)
# PROJECT CHECKLIST
- Finish writing out plot of the game
- Separate scenes by different text files
- Create images for online portion of the game
- Create webpage for online portion of game
- Connect both portions of the game
- Program the whole darn thing.
Yeup that's about it.
